Predicting Group Membership from Language:
	•	The random forest model is applied to the embedded (vectorized) representations of texts: entrepreneurs’ questions, AI advice provided, and reported business changes.
	•	The aim is to see whether the content of these texts can predict whether an entrepreneur belongs to the “high performer” or “low performer” group, or whether they received the AI intervention.
	•	The model tests if there are distinct patterns in language used and actions reported by high versus low performers.
